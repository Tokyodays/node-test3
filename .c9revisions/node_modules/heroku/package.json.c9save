Each function has been carefully fed to monkeys who, through patience and understanding, had been trained to translate basic ruby into coffee script.\\n\\n<table>\\n  <tr><td><img src=\\\"https://github.com/toots/node-heroku/raw/master/misc/monkey.png\\\" alt=\\\"A monkey in action\\\" title=\\\"A monkey in action\\\"/></td></tr>\\n  <tr><td>A monkey in action</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n\\nThose monkeys' education cost a lot so we could not afford tests for this code. However, we guarantee that no animal was hurt while preparing this module.\\n\\nHow to use?\\n===========\\n\\nAPI exported by this module is _exactly_ the same as API exported by  [heroku/heroku.rb](https://github.com/heroku/heroku.rb). Yes, this also means that some variables are not camelCased.
